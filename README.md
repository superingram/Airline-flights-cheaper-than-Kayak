# Airline-flights-cheaper-than-Kayak

This project will use the concept of Dynamic Programming to construct an algorithm in the R programming language for finding the cheapest flights for any given matrix of airlines and their prices whether the flight is direct or has layovers.  Memoization will be employed to keep run times from slowing to a crawl.  The algorithm may be used to develop a website for flight cost reduction optimization.
